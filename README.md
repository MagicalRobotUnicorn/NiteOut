# NiteOut

## Overview

The NiteOut application was my first group project developed in conjunction with a team of students at the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp. The application utilizes two APIs, Yelp and Songkick, to deliver to the user near by places to eat and drink near any event in their area. After selecting the event and the establishment, the user adds it to the calendar, currently residing in the user's local storage. One of the more notable experiences of coding the application was abiding by the licenses to use the APIs. Another was the deployment to Heroku.

## Coding Practices

The technologies employed in this project include HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Heroku.
